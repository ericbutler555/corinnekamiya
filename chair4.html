<td><small style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">i did this
project in boston. this project was about how memory can be fragile
without a shared history. i started it because i felt sort of adrift in
boston and i wanted to give the red boxes, the remnants of labor, as a
symbol of this process and as a physical tie between myself and my
community. and then the contemporary museum in hawaii asked me to make
it again. so i did. and it seems strange but wonderful to have made
this again in hawaii. even though carrying a glass chair in my carry-on
luggage was extraordinarily nerve-wracking.</span></small></td>
