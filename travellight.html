<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">when i was
nineteen i moved away from hawaii. it was a big deal to me, the first
time i had ever moved anywhere. and in an effort to learn to travel
lightly, i decided to take large format pictures of all of the pictures
i had ever took and all the stuff that was on my walls when i was
younger. and when it was done, i made posters and threw all of the
actual pictures out. sometimes i regret it,&nbsp;sometimes i am
amazed that i really did it, and sometimes i feel this thing that i did
when i was nineteen changed so much about how i make art and how i
live. </span></font></span></td>
